# RPC Toggle

## CURRENTLY WIP

### Plugin planned features once completed:

It's supposed to be just a simple button that allows the user's rich presence to toggle 
on and off, with settings that allow the user to decide whether the plugin disables 
only game activity, spotify activity, or both.

### Plans for the plugin after completion:

I'm planning to add comments to the code, to allow other developers to see how 
my plugin works in a more digestible manner.

### For support, reach out to me at bridgebucket#9606 as I do not have a server and never plan to.
